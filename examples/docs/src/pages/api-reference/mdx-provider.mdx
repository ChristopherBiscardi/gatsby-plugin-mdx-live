# MDXProvider

## Usage

```js
import { MDXProvider } from '@mdx-js/react';

const MyH1 = props => <h1 style={{ color: 'tomato' }} {...props} />
const MyParagraph = props => <p style={{ fontSize: '18px', lineHeight: 1.6 }} />

const components = {
  h1: MyH1,
  p: MyParagraph
}

export const wrapRootElement = ({ element }) => (
  <MDXProvider components={components}>{element}</MDXProvider>
)
```

## Info

`MDXProvider` is a React component that allows you to replace the
rendering of tags in MDX content. It does this by providing a list of
components via context to the internal `MDXTag` component that handles
rendering of base tags like `p` and `h1`. There are two special tags
that can be replaced too: `inlineCode` and `wrapper`. `inlineCode` is
for inline `<code>` and `wrapper` is the special element that wraps
all of the MDX content.

## Note

It's important to define the `components` you pass in in a stable way
so that the references don't change if you want to be able to navigate
to a hash. That's why we defined `components` outside of any render
functions in these examples.
