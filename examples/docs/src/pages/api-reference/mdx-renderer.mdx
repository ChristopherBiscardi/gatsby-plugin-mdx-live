# MDXRenderer

## Usage

```js
import { MDXRenderer } from 'gatsby-mdx';

export default class MyPageLayout {
  render() {
    <MDXRenderer>{this.props.data.mdx.code.body}</MDXRenderer>
  }
}

export const pageQuery = graphql`
  query MDXQuery($id: String!) {
    mdx(id: { eq: $id }) {
      id
      code {
        body
      }
    }
  }
`;
```

## Info

`MDXRenderer` is a React component that takes *compiled* MDX content and
renders it. You will need to use this if your MDX content is coming
from a GraphQL page query or `StaticQuery`.

`MDXRenderer` takes any prop and passes it on to your MDX content,
just like a normal React component.

```js
<MDXRenderer title="My Stuff!">{mdx.code.body}</MDXRenderer>
```

### Manually Providing Scope

**Note** You should never need to do what is explained here under
normal library usage. If you think you need to it is possible there
is a bug and you should file an issue.

`MDXRenderer` accepts a `scope` prop that can be used in special
circumstances to override the imports provided to MDX content.
Think of `scope` like an object where we have import names as keys
and the import value as the value.

An example `scope` object may look like this. Note that `React` and
`MDXTag` are already imported by `MDXRenderer` and added to *any* 
scope passed in. Therefore they never need to be provided in 
practice. This is just an example.

```js
import React from 'react';
import { MDXTag } from '@mdx-js/tag';

const scope = {
  React: React,
  MDXTag: MDXTag
}

<MDXRenderer scope={scope} title="My Stuff!">{mdx.code.body}</MDXRenderer>
```
