# Programmatically Creating Pages

Sometimes you want to be able to programmatically access data from
files in `src/pages` or create pages using MDX content lives at
arbitrary locations outside of `src/pages/` or in remote CMSs.

For instance, let's say you have a Gatsby website, and you want to add
support for MDX so you can start your blog. The posts will live in
`content/posts/`.

You can do this with the help of `gatsby-source-filesystem`, and some
calls to `createPages` in `gatsby-node.js`. Let's dive in.

<h2 id='install-dependencies'>1. Install Dependencies</h2>

If you haven't installed gatsby-mdx, [do that now](/installation). You
will also need to install `gatsby-source-filesystem`.

To install everything, from the root of your Gatsby project run:

```sh
npm install gatsby-mdx @mdx-js/tag @mdx-js/mdx gatsby-source-filesystem
```

<h2 id='edit-your-gatsby-config'>2. Edit Your `gatsby-config.js`</h2>

To let Gatsby know that you'll be working with MDX content you need to
add `gatsby-mdx` to the plugins array in your `gatsby-config.js`
file.

> note: `gatsby-mdx` uses `.mdx` by default as a file extension to
> recognize which files to use. You can also [use `.md` as a file
> extension](api-reference/options/extensions) if you want.

```javascript
/* gatsby-config.js */

module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    /* 1) this adds support for *.mdx files in gatsby */
    "gatsby-mdx",

    /*
     * 2) this adds a collection called "posts"
     * that looks for files in `content/posts/`
     */
    {
      resolve: "gatsby-source-filesystem",
      options: {
        name: "posts",
        path: `${__dirname}/content/posts/`
      }
    }
  ]
};
```

Here you're telling Gatsby "Look in a folder called `content/posts`
that's located in the root of my project. Make any file inside
accessible through a GraphQL query and set the `sourceInstanceName`
property on the file nodes to `posts`"

You can read about
[gatsby-source-filesystem](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/packages/gatsby-source-filesystem#readme)
if you'd like to learn more.

<h2 id='add-mdx-files'>3. Add MDX Files</h2>

Before you can write any GraphQL queries, and programmatically create
pages, you need to add some content.

Make a folder called `content/posts` and create two files in it called
`blog-1.mdx` and `blog-2.mdx`. You can do this on the command line in
a terminal by using the following commands from the root of your
project.

`mkdir -p path/to/a/directory` will create every folder in the path if
it does not exist.

`touch <filename>` will create an empty file named `<filename>`. The
brackets (`{`) are [an
expansion](https://twitter.com/kentcdodds/status/1083399683932868609?s=19)
which means we can create multiple files in one command.

```sh
mkdir -p content/posts
touch content/posts/blog-{1,2}.mdx
```

Open up each of the files you just created and add some content.

```md
---
title: "Blog Post 1"
---

Trying out MDX
```

```md
---
title: "Blog Post 2"
---

Gatsby is the best
```

<h2 id='generate-slugs'>4. Generate Slugs</h2>

Because we're programmatically creating pages, we need to tell Gatsby
which page should be at which URL. We'll do that using another API
named a `nodeField`, but if you want to set the URLs in your
frontmatter, you can skip this step.

```js
// in gatsby-node.js
const { createFilePath } = require("gatsby-source-filesystem");

exports.onCreateNode = ({ node, actions, getNode }) => {
  const { createNodeField } = actions;

  // We only want to operate on `Mdx` nodes. If we had content from a
  // remote CMS we could also check to see if the parent node was a
  // `File` node here
  if (node.internal.type === "Mdx") {
    const value = createFilePath({ node, getNode });

    createNodeField({
      // 1) this is the name of the field you are adding,
      name: "slug",
      // 2) this node refers to each individual MDX
      node,
      value: `/blog${value}`
    });
  }
};
```

The `value` in the `createNodeField` call is the URL we'll use later
to set up our page. `/blog${value}` is a [template
string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals)
that will result in:

- blog-1.mdx => "localhost:8000/blog/blog-1/"
- blog-2.mdx => "localhost:8000/blog/blog-2/"

[createFilePath](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-source-filesystem/?=gatsby-source#createfilepath)
is a function from `gatsby-source-filesystem` that translates file
paths to usable URLs.

[onCreateNode](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/node-apis/#onCreateNode)
is a Gatsby lifecycle method that gets called whenever a new node is
created. In this case we make sure we only touch `Mdx` nodes.

<h2 id='query-for-mdx-files'>5. Query For MDX Files</h2>

Now we need to write a GraphQL query that we can use to create a set
of pages. Start up Gatsby in development mode, and open up
GraphiQL. In the root of your Gatsby project run:

```sh
gatsby develop
```

Then, in your browser open up <a
href='https://localhost:8000/___graphql'
target='_blank'>https://localhost:8000/\_\_\_graphql</a> and paste the
following into GraphiQL:

```graphql
query {
  allMdx {
    edges {
      node {
        id
        fields {
          # this is the slug field you created in the last section
          slug
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This is the basic query you need to create your mdx pages, but you can
edit and add to this to fit your needs. If you skipped the last step
and want to use frontmatter for your slugs instead of the generated
field, replace `fields` with `frontmatter`.

<h2 id="create-pages">6. Create Pages From Your Query</h2>

We'll use the query we just saw working in GraphiQL to query Gatsby's
node system and create a set of pages from those nodes. The Gatsby API
we need to use is called
[createPages](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/node-apis/#createPages).

```javascript
// in gatsby-node.js
const path = require("path");

exports.createPages = ({ graphql, actions }) => {
  // Destructure the createPage function from the actions object
  const { createPage } = actions;

  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    resolve(
      graphql(
        `
          {
            allMdx {
              edges {
                node {
                  id
                  fields {
                    slug
                  }
                }
              }
            }
          }
        `
      ).then(result => {
        // this is some boilerlate to handle errors
        if (result.errors) {
          console.error(result.errors);
          reject(result.errors);
        }

        // We'll call `createPage` for each result
        result.data.allMdx.edges.forEach(({ node }) => {
          createPage({
            // This is the slug we created before
            // (or `node.frontmatter.slug`)
            path: node.fields.slug,
            // This component will wrap our MDX content
            component: path.resolve(`./src/components/posts-page-layout.js`),
            // We can use the values in this context in
            // our page layout component
            context: { id: node.id }
          });
        });
      })
    );
  });
};
```

<h2 id="make-a-template">7. Make A Template For Your Blog Posts</h2>

Make a file called `posts-page-layout.js` in `src/components`. We need
to use a special component from `gatsby-mdx` called `MDXRenderer` to
render any programmatically accessd MDX content.

```jsx
// src/components/posts-page-layout.js
import React from "react";
import { graphql } from "gatsby";
import MDXRenderer from "gatsby-mdx/mdx-renderer";

function PageTemplate({ data: { mdx } }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{mdx.frontmatter.title}</h1>
      <MDXRenderer>{mdx.code.body}</MDXRenderer>
    </div>
  );
}

/*
 *
 * `id` is passed in through the `context` object from `createPage`
 * GraphQL requires us to declare the type of arguments at the top
 * of the query before using them in the query body. We don't need to
 * worry about finding the `id` value from the props and passing it in
 * because we put it in `context` so Gatsby handles that for us.
 *
 */
export const pageQuery = graphql`
  query BlogPostQuery($id: String) {
    mdx(id: { eq: $id }) {
      id
      frontmatter {
        title
      }
      code {
        body
      }
    }
  }
`;
```

That's it, you're done. Run `gatsby develop` and enjoy your new MDX
powers.

with Gatsby and `gatsby-mdx`. Check out our other guides to find out
more about all of the cool stuff you can do with `gatsby-mdx`.

<h2 id="bonus">8. Bonus: Make a Blog Index</h2>

```jsx
// src/pages/index.js
import React from 'react'
import { Link, graphql } from 'gatsby'

const BlogIndex = ({ data }) => {
  const { edges: posts } = data.allMdx

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Awesome MDX Blog</h1>

      <ul>
        {posts.map(({ node: post }) => (
          <li key={post.id}>
            <Link to={post.fields.slug}>
              <h2>{post.frontmatter.title}</h2>
            </Link>
            <p>{post.excerpt}</p>
          </li>
        ))
      </ul>
    </div>
  )
}

export const pageQuery = graphql`
  query blogIndex {
    allMdx {
      edges {
        node {
          id
          excerpt
          frontmatter {
            title
          }
          fields {
            slug
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
`

export default BlogIndex

```
